# True Top-Down 2D

[This is a tutorial series for how to get started with Godot Engine 4](https://catlikecoding.com/godot/introduction/), by building a clock and doing stuff with it. We begin as simple as possible and gradually introduce more advanced concepts.

[This is a tutorial series](https://catlikecoding.com/godot/true-top-down-2d/) that goes through the process of creating a simple true top-down 2D game with Godot Engine 4.

This series is aimed at beginners who are completely new to game development, but more advanced developers that are new to Godot will also find it useful.

It is assumed that you went through the [Introduction series](https://catlikecoding.com/godot/introduction) or are familiar with Godot Engine 4.

Each Individual tutorial has its own numbered folder.
